# upGrad-TelecomChurnCaseStudy

# Problem Statement

This is a student exercise using telecom churn data. The goal is to build a model to predict customer churn probability. The data is provided in two parts: one dataset with known churn outcomes (`train.csv`) and another without churn outcomes (`test.csv`).

### Exercise Overview:

1. **80% weightage:** Focus on building the best model for the business caseâ€”predicting churn probability based on multiple KPIs.
2. **20% weightage:** A submission to a Kaggle competition, where the model is evaluated on unseen data (`test.csv`).

The data contains KPIs measured across months, and our EDA will explore how these KPIs evolve over time. We will also test different models to compare their performance and choose the best one for Kaggle submission.

The model with the highest accuracy will be selected for the Kaggle submission, even if it is not the best across all evaluation metrics.
